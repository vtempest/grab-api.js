# PROSPER License
**Peer Review of Open Source Public Exhibits with Recognition**

## Preamble: Open Source Benefits Creators and Society

Open source creative commons functions as a distributed peer review system, similar to academic peer review that validates scientific research. When code is transparent and accessible, it harnesses collective intelligence to identify issues, suggest improvements, and create more robust software. This collaborative approach benefits all parties: contributors gain access to high-quality, community-vetted code; original authors receive valuable improvements and bug fixes from the community; and society advances through accelerated innovation and shared knowledge.

The PROSPER License extends this philosophy by integrating blockchain-based token economies with traditional open source licensing. This creates a sustainable ecosystem where infinite digital copy goods (software, music, video, content) can be freely distributed while establishing fair compensation mechanisms through community-driven funding pools and usage-based token distribution. Creators want their cultural works to be remixed, reviewed, and reditributed infinitely, so as at create a shared online international culture of the creative commons. This license is compatible with CC BY-NC Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International. 

By releasing works under this license, you join a collaborative ecosystem that embodies the principle that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" while ensuring creators receive recognition and compensation for their contributions through transparent, automated blockchain systems.

## License Terms

**Copyright (c) [year] [fullname] [email_or_url]**

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Work"), to deal in the Work without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and to permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

### Dual Licensing Structure

**For Non-Commercial and Small Business Use (Annual Revenue under $5 million USD):**

The Work may be used freely under the following terms:
- The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Work
- Any derivative works or modifications must be shared under this same license
- Proper attribution must be provided to original authors in all distributions
- Source code must be made available for any distributed derivative works
- Commercial use is permitted provided annual revenue remains below the threshold
- Participation in the PROSPER CREDIT system is optional but encouraged

**For Commercial Use (Annual Revenue $5 million USD or more):**

Organizations meeting or exceeding the revenue threshold must:
- Contact the licensor to obtain a separate commercial licensing agreement
- Participate in the PROSPER CREDIT system for usage tracking and creator compensation
- Commercial licensing provides additional rights and removes certain obligations
- Enterprise support and services may be available under commercial terms

### PROSPER CREDIT System Integration

All uses of the Work under this license may participate in the PROSPER CREDIT system, which provides:

**Usage Tracking**: Blockchain-based immutable usage logs that provide cryptographic proof of access while maintaining user privacy through decentralized tracking mechanisms.

**Token Distribution**: Automated distribution of PROSPER tokens to creators based on:
- Usage metrics (normalized usage counts)
- Community reputation scores (0-1 scale)
- Collaboration factors (multipliers for collaborative contributions)
- Weighted graph analysis of creator contribution networks

### Attribution Requirements

When using this Work, you must:
- Include the original copyright notice in all copies
- Clearly identify the original authors and contributors
- Provide a link to the original source repository when technically feasible
- Note any significant modifications made to the original work
- Maintain all existing attribution notices in derivative works
- If participating in PROSPER CREDIT, ensure proper creator attribution in blockchain records

### Source Code Sharing

For any distribution of the Work or derivative works:
- Complete source code must be made available under the same license terms
- Source code must be provided in a preferred form for making modifications
- Build scripts and installation instructions should be included when applicable
- Dependencies and third-party components must be clearly documented

### Patent Grant

Each contributor grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such contributor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Work.


### License Compatibility

This license is designed to be compatible with other open source licenses while maintaining its blockchain integration. When combining this Work with code under different licenses, the most restrictive terms apply to the combined work. Commercial licensees have separate compatibility provisions.

### Termination

This license automatically terminates if you fail to comply with its terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use and distribution of the Work and destroy all copies in your possession. PROSPER CREDIT system participation may continue under separate terms.

## Warranty and Liability

The work is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the work or the use or other dealings in the work.

## Understanding the PROSPER Model

The PROSPER License addresses the challenge of balancing open source accessibility with creator sustainability through blockchain technology. Unlike purely permissive licenses that offer no revenue model or restrictive copyleft licenses that can deter enterprise adoption, this approach creates a sustainable middle ground that encourages innovation while ensuring fair creator compensation.

### Benefits for Different Users

**Individual Developers and Researchers** receive unrestricted access to high-quality works with the assurance that improvements will be shared back to the community. Optional participation in the PROSPER CREDIT system provides additional recognition and potential compensation.

**Small Businesses and Startups** with revenue under five million dollars can use the works freely, including for commercial purposes. The generous threshold provides substantial room for business growth before commercial licensing becomes necessary.

**Educational and Non-Profit Organizations** benefit from complete freedom to use, modify, and redistribute works for their missions without restriction.

**Large Enterprises** receive clear licensing options with legal certainty and support. Commercial licensing provides enterprise-grade support while ensuring participation in fair creator compensation systems.

### Community Development Philosophy

The PROSPER framework embodies the principle that creative work benefits from transparency, collaborative review, and fair compensation. By integrating blockchain technology with traditional open source licensing, it creates a sustainable ecosystem where creators can focus on innovation while the community ensures quality and provides economic support.

This model transforms traditional intellectual property frameworks into commons-based ownership structures where creators are compensated through community funding pools rather than restrictive licensing, enabling the free distribution of infinite digital copy goods while maintaining creator sustainability. This license represents an evolution in open source licensing that addresses modern creative work realities while preserving the collaborative spirit that makes open source development valuable to society.
