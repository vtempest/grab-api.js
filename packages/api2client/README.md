# api2client

Generate a fully typed SDK from an OpenAPI spec with [Hey API](https://heyapi.dev), then let [grab](https://grab.js.org) send the requests instead of axios or fetch.

The generated code is unchanged — the same `getPet()`, `createPet()` functions, the same types. Only the transport underneath is swapped, so every endpoint in the SDK gains caching, retries, rate limiting, request deduplication, a mock server and the shared request log.

```ts
import { getPet } from "./client";

const { data, error, response } = await getPet({
  path: { petId: "42" },
  cache: true,        // grab options work per request
  retryAttempts: 2,
});
```

## Install

```bash
npm i api2client
npm i -D @hey-api/openapi-ts
```

## Generate

```bash
npx api2client https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json ./src/client
```

That runs `@hey-api/openapi-ts` and rewires the output to this client. Options:

| Option                   | Purpose                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i, --input <path\|url>` | OpenAPI spec to generate from                              |
| `-o, --output <dir>`     | Where to write the SDK — default `./src/client`            |
| `-c, --client <name>`    | Hey API client to generate against — default `@hey-api/client-fetch` |
| `--rewire-only`          | Skip generation, rewire an SDK you already generated       |
| `--no-rewire`            | Generate without swapping in the grab client               |

Anything else is forwarded to the `openapi-ts` CLI. The same thing from Node:

```ts
import { generateFromOpenAPI } from "api2client";

await generateFromOpenAPI({ input: "./openapi.yaml", output: "./src/client" });
```

Already generating with your own `openapi-ts.config.ts`? Keep it, and rewire afterwards:

```jsonc
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "codegen": "openapi-ts && api2client --rewire-only ./src/client"
}
```

## Configure

The generated `client.gen.ts` exports a `client` you can configure once for the whole SDK:

```ts
import { client } from "./client/client.gen";

client.setConfig({
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  auth: () => localStorage.getItem("token"),

  // grab options, applied to every request in the SDK
  cache: true,
  cacheForTime: 60,
  retryAttempts: 2,
  rateLimit: 1,
  timeout: 15,
});
```

Or build a client yourself:

```ts
import { createClient, createConfig } from "api2client";

const client = createClient(createConfig({ baseUrl: "https://api.example.com" }));
```

### grab options

Every option below is accepted client-wide in `createConfig()`/`setConfig()` and per request. See [grab options](https://grab.js.org/docs/grab-options) for the full reference.

| Option                                 | Effect                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `cache`, `cacheForTime`                | Serve repeated requests from grab's frontend cache  |
| `retryAttempts`                        | Retry failed requests                               |
| `rateLimit`                            | Minimum seconds between requests to the same path   |
| `timeout`                              | Seconds before the request is aborted               |
| `cancelOngoingIfNew`, `cancelNewIfOngoing` | Deduplicate concurrent requests to the same path |
| `debug`, `logger`                      | Log requests and responses                          |
| `unzip`, `parseDOM`, `unescapeHTML`    | Opt back into grab's ZIP/HTML post-processing       |
| `grab`                                 | Use a custom grab instance, e.g. `grab.instance({})` |

### Mock any endpoint

`grab.mock` keys are request paths (with or without a leading slash), so an SDK endpoint can be stubbed without touching the network:

```ts
import { grab } from "grab-url";

grab.mock["/pets/42"] = { response: { id: "42", name: "Rex" } };

const { data } = await getPet({ path: { petId: "42" } }); // { id: "42", name: "Rex" }
```

## What you get back

The standard Hey API result — `{ data, error, request, response }`, or just `data` with `responseStyle: "data"`, or a thrown error with `throwOnError: true`:

```ts
const { data, error, response } = await getPet({ path: { petId: "99" } });

if (error) console.log(response.status, error); // 404 { message: "Pet not found" }
```

`buildUrl()`, `interceptors.request/response/error`, `security`/`auth`, `bodySerializer`, `querySerializer`, `parseAs`, `responseValidator` and `responseTransformer` all behave as they do in the official clients.

## Server-sent events

An operation whose response is `text/event-stream` generates an SDK function that calls `client.sse.<method>()` instead of `client.<method>()`, and returns `{ stream }` — an async generator of parsed event data:

```ts
import { streamJobEvents } from "./client";

const { stream } = await streamJobEvents({ path: { jobId: "42" } });

for await (const event of stream) console.log(event); // parsed `data:` payload
```

SSE is a long-lived connection, not a single request/response, so it connects with `fetch` directly instead of going through grab — grab's cache/retry/rate-limit model is built around a request that completes, not one that stays open and reconnects on its own. Pass these alongside the usual request options:

| Option                    | Effect                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onSseEvent`               | Called for every event, with its `data`, `event`, `id` and `retry`  |
| `onSseError`               | Called when a connection attempt fails, before it retries           |
| `sseDefaultRetryDelay`     | default=3000 Delay before the first retry, in ms                    |
| `sseMaxRetryAttempts`      | Give up after this many retry attempts                              |
| `sseMaxRetryDelay`         | default=30000 Cap on the exponential backoff delay, in ms           |
| `fetch`                    | Fetch implementation to use — default=`globalThis.fetch`            |

Reconnects honor the server's `retry:` field and send `Last-Event-ID` from the last event's `id:`, matching browser `EventSource` semantics. A stream that ends normally (the server closes the connection) does not reconnect — only a network or parse error does.

## Differences from `@hey-api/client-fetch`

- **Transport failures are returned, not thrown.** A timeout or connection failure comes back as `{ error }` (or throws when `throwOnError` is set), matching grab's "errors are data" behavior. HTTP error statuses behave the same as in the official clients.
- **Bodies are parsed by grab.** `parseAs: "stream"` hands you the raw stream, and an explicit `parseAs` still decides the empty-response shape, but otherwise grab's content-type detection reads the body.
- **grab sets JSON `Content-Type`/`Accept` defaults** on requests that do not specify their own, including body-less ones.
- **Response interceptors run before parsing**, on a response whose body grab has already read.
- **`sse` endpoints bypass grab** and connect with `fetch` directly — see [Server-sent events](#server-sent-events).

## Requirements

Works with any `grab-url` ≥ 1.6.22. On 1.6.23 and later it also uses the `onRawResponse` hook to report the response status, headers and parsed error payloads; on older versions those degrade to grab's error message (`"HTTP error: 404 Not Found"`) and a synthesized 200 response. The client detects support and never sends options an older grab would turn into query parameters.

Serialization and SSE streaming in `src/core/` are ported from Hey API's client core (MIT) so generated SDKs produce identical URLs, bodies and event streams on any client.
