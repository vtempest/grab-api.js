## Beige Color Themes are Best for Reading Text Online

- **Beige emits less blue light reducing eye strain** and make reading more comfortable for long periods, helping to minimize eye fatigue and potential sleep disruption. White backgrounds have more blue, a high-energy, short-wavelength color that can disrupt sleep and cause eye strain, unlike longer wavelength colors (yellow, orange, red, beige)
- **Beige themes improve readability** by providing good contrast with dark text, making letters stand out clearly.
- **Warm tones like beige are proven to boost reading speed and performance** compared to cooler backgrounds like blue or green.
- **Beige creates a calm, inviting atmosphere** that encourages longer, more focused reading sessions.
